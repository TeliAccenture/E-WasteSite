            <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
            <p>E-Waste are the resources left behind when we dispose of our electronics. E-Waste is hard
                to dispose of due to the products used to make our electronics, and is made up of our TV's,
            Laptops and much more. It can even include children's toys that have electronic components.</p>

           <div id = "whyIsItAProblem">
            <h2>Why is it a problem?</h2>
            <p>Our modern lives often revolve around technology. We frequently dispose of technology as we retire it,
                whether disposed of because it is broken or obselete. Recycling electronics is hard, costly and often 
                hazardous if done incorrectly. This results in a lot of waste at landfill that will take centuries to 
                decay.

           <div id = "whatCanIDo">
            <h2>What can I do?</h2>
            <p>The E-Waste problem starts at home, to help combat this global issue it's important to properly 
                recycle your tech when it's broken. You could also encourage re-using of your tech when you 
                replace it. For example you could sell it for parts, donate it to a charity or pass it down in 
                your family. You could also try and not buy new tech products if your old version still works.
